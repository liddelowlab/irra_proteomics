[2023-01-26 18:07:31.086] [jointLog] [info] Counted 19,988,182 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2023-01-26 18:07:31.090] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00164593% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
