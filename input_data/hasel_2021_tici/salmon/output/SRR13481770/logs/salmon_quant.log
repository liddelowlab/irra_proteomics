[2023-01-26 18:09:42.631] [jointLog] [info] Counted 28,038,507 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2023-01-26 18:09:42.634] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000648568% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
