[2023-08-28 21:00:57.234] [jointLog] [info] Counted 37,567,311 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2023-08-28 21:00:57.239] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0119371% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
