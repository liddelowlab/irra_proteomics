[2023-08-28 21:12:25.336] [jointLog] [info] Counted 32,565,698 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2023-08-28 21:12:25.340] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0190404% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
