[2023-08-28 21:20:43.921] [jointLog] [info] Counted 41,714,868 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2023-08-28 21:20:43.928] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0111233% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
